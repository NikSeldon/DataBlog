### Phase of Exponential Growth in Europe

#### Getting Data

The article is an exploration of COVID-19 data. The data is provided by the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). A Github repository that contains daily updated data of  

* confirmed incidence cases 
* cases of death and 
* recovered cases

### Phase of Exponential Growth
#### 02-15 to 03-31 2020

Currently, all countries in Europe are in the epidemic phase of were the increase of incidence can be described by a law of exponential growth. epidemiologist may write $I_d=I_0* C^d$, where $I_d, I_0$ are the number of infected people at day $d$ and the initial value of infected people. The factor $C$ contains the average number $E$ of people, an infected person is exposed to each day, and the propability $p$ of each exposure becoming an infection. The exponential growth can be slowed down, when $E$ and/or $p$ can be minimised. Instead of $C$, Physicists would use the exponential base $e$: $I_d=I_0 * e^{(k*d)}$. The logarithmic plot of cumulative incidences $ln(I_d/I_0)=k*d$ yields a straight line, with the slope $k$. Finally the doubling time - the time it reqiures the number of infected people has doubled -  can be calculated: $T_2 = ln(2)/k$. Results are presented below in the section "Doubling Times".

#### Daily incremental incident cases (Epidemic Curves)

Let's look at the daily incremental incidence. 
The curve, that is visualized as bar chart here is known as the epidemic curve and shows the new confirmed cases on a daily basis.  The distribution of incidences over time, provides an indication of where the outbreak is in its course. Is the number of new cases still increasing or has the outbreak already peaked? As the the outbreak spreads, the shape of the epi curve might show overlapping waves of cases or new subsequent outbreaks. A plateau in the curve of daily new incidences in some countries could be expected as the result of the social distancing measures that are introduced in european countries around the middle of March (starting from 16th to 20th of March).


```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 10, echo=TRUE}
title<-paste("COVID-19 daily incident confirmed cases\n data from Johns Hopkins University: ", dateDownloaded)
caption<-"Source: Johns Hopkins CSSE Novel coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV)\n data repository: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19"

ggplot(confirmedCasesSelected, aes(x = Date, y = incident_cases))+ 
  geom_col(color="blue", alpha=0.5)+
  #geom_line(color="blue",alpha=0.4, size=.3) + 
  #geom_point(color="blue", alpha=0.5, size=2)+
  facet_wrap(country_region ~ ., scale = "free_y")+
  labs(y = "Daily incident confirmed cases", title = title, 
       subtitle = "(Note: different y-axis scales)", caption = caption)+
  theme(legend.position = "none", legend.title = element_blank())
```


### Doubling Times
#### (Time it requires the amount of confirmed cases doubles)

The following plot shows developments of doubling times for various countries in europe. Increasing doubling times meaning a significant slowing down of the spreading of disease and must be considered as a result of social distancing and quaratine measures. There is no other measure as e.g. vaccination at this time. Also the exponential growth is not slowed down by the increasing amount of already recovered people. This effect may play a role when >10%...20%...30% of the population have become immune.

We can see, that e.g. for Austria and Switzerland the doubling times increase significantly, due to quarantine measures, whereas the increase is smaller in countries like Netherlands and France. In Sweden the spreading of disease even accelerates. ... of course, the total amount of tests, respectively the limits of testing are not considered here.   

```{r fig.height = 7, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
title<-paste("COVID-19 Doubling Times of Confirmed Cases \nData from:", dateDownloaded)
caption<-"Source: Johns Hopkins CSSE Novel coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV)\n data repository: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19"

ggplot(confirmedCasesSelected%>%filter(Date>="2020-03-17"), aes(x = Date, y = T2))+ 
  geom_line(color="blue", alpha=0.4, cex=1) + 
  geom_point(color="blue", alpha=0.4, cex=2)+
  geom_smooth(data=confirmedCasesSelected%>%filter(Date>="2020-03-17"), method = "lm",formula =y ~x, col="purple")+
  facet_wrap(country_region ~ .)+
  labs(y = "Cumulative confirmed cases", title = title, 
       subtitle = "", caption = caption) +
  xlim(c(as.Date('2020-03-15 00:00:00', format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
         as.Date('2020-05-01 00:00:00', format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")))+
  ylim(c(0,30))+
  theme(legend.position = "none", legend.title = element_blank())
```


I analysed two periods, the begining and the end of march, separately to show how the doubling time has changed over time. The observed increase in doubling time by approximately a factor of 2 might be considered as the result of the social distancing and quarantine measures, that were intensified in european countries around the 15th of March 2020.

##### Doubling time beginning of March

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Beginning of March
for(i in seq_along(countries)){
fitdata<-filter(confirmedCasesSelected,country_region == countries[i], Date >= "2020-03-01", Date <= "2020-03-15")%>%
  mutate(logCases=log(cumulative_cases))
model<-lm(logCases ~ Date, data = fitdata)
print(paste(countries[i], ": " ,round(log(2)/coef(model)[2],1), "days"))
}
```

##### Doubling time at the end of March
```{r echo=TRUE}
for(i in seq_along(countries)){
  fitdata<-filter(confirmedCasesSelected,country_region == countries[i], Date >= "2020-03-16", Date <= dateDownloaded)%>%
    mutate(logCases=log(cumulative_cases))
  model<-lm(logCases ~ Date, data = fitdata)
  print(paste(countries[i], ": " ,round(log(2)/coef(model)[2],1), "days"))
}
```
